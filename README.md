# DoubleHearts
Double Hearts is a double-deck version of the Hearts game on early Windows systems. 

# Usage
Run server at port `32266`: (default port is `23366`)
```
java -jar DoubleHeartsServer.jar -p 32266
```

Run client in English and connect to server at IP address `142.857.428.571` (obviously fake) with port [32266]:
```
java -jar DoubleHeartsClient.jar -l en -a 142.857.428.571 -p 32266 
```

Enjoy!
